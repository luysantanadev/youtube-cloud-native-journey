## How to Search

| You see...                                       | Look for tag        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Pod restarts, `FailedCreatePodSandBox`           | `#cni` `#k3d`       |
| StatefulSet `0/N ready`, `FailedCreate`          | `#statefulset`      |
| `serviceaccount "X" not found`                   | `#rbac` `#operator` |
| Helm install failing with ownership error        | `#helm`             |
| All pods restarting at the same time             | `#wsl2` `#k3d`      |
| Liveness/readiness probe failures on startup     | `#probe`            |
| MongoDB not starting                             | `#mongodb`          |

## Recurring Patterns

- **WSL2 reboots** always cause a cascade restart wave (~3–6 restarts/pod). All pods recover automatically. No action needed.
- **Helm operators** must be installed **before** applying CRs/manifests that depend on them (ServiceAccounts, CRDs, webhooks).
